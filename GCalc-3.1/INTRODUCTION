Dear you,

If you're reading this, you've got your hands on the source code for
GCalc.  You are extremely courageous or have some screw loose
upstairs.  In either case, thanks for you interest!  Hopefully looking
at my code won't mess you up too much.

Just briefly, GCalc is _primarily_ a graphing calculator application
written in Java.  I wrote it for fun and exercise, gearing it mostly
for pedagogical use by teachers and students in math.

That's all I wanted to say.  

SDG,
