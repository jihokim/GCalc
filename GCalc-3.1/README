RUNNING THE PROGRAM

The following instructions assume that you have a suitable version of
Java installed already.  I'm going to also assume that you have the
executable for java (e.g. java.exe) in your path variable.


Via web browser:

  > Go to http://gcalc.net
  > Click on the link for GCalc

  Note: The GCalc web site will change over time.  


Via command line:

  > cd directory-that-contains-gcalc.net
  > java -cp gcalc-3.1-bin.jar net.gcalc.calc.GCalc 

  Note: Instead of 'java' you might want to use 'javaw' on Windows.
